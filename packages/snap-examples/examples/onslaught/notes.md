Run 100 instance

At around 80 instance the latency of communication between UI and the background of the extension became noticable (around second or so)

The memory footprint of the extension hovered at 440mb

The memory footprint of all iframes hovered at 540mb

The CPU load was single-threaded, meaing my system as well as the extension was completely fine and usable

The CPU load was 100% for that thread
